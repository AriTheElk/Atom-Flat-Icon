## ... why?
I can't be the only one turned off by the atrocious Atom.io icon that sat on my OS X dock alongside some of the beautiful icons of 10.10 (Yosemite). So I decided to try my hand at creating a suitable replacement icon that went along with the rest of my OS. Although it was originally made for Yosemite, it can be used on any OS as a nice replacement of the default green icon.

## Installation
### OS X
1. Right click on Atom.app and hit "Show Package Contents"
2. Go into Contents/Resources
3. Drag the `atom.icns` from either the light, dark, or colored folder and the `file.icns` into the Resources folder (hit yes to replace)
4. You will have to log out and back in to see the changes. If the changes don't show up after a log-in, hold âŒ˜ and click the Atom icon in your dock.

### Windows
I don't use windows, because it doesn't fit with my UNIX-powered development workflow. But I found a [tutorial here](http://www.wikihow.com/Change-the-Icon-for-an-Exe-File) that looks like it works (albeit a longer solution than on Mac, but what do you expect from windows?)
